When the vehicle parks in the hot environment, the temperature inside the cabin would increase substantially, and has a bad impact on the comfort of occupants. Ventilation is an effective cooling method to keep vehicle interior temperature in normal room temperature or less Than that temperature. This project proposes a solution to reduce high temperatures present inside the vehicles to make comfortable the people who are using vehicles. The Cool Car project is an Arduino micro controller based device working with help of Android platform application. The device identifies the vehicle interior temperature and sends notification to the user if the temperature increased above a particular limit. The user can switch on the car blower fan or external exhaust fan to reduce the temperature.
